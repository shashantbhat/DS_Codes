# DS Lab Assignments - Semester 3 - 2023

Welcome to the repository for Semester 3 Data Structures (DS) assignments for CSE students at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida - Sector 62. This repository contains the coding assignments for the DS subject during the third semester.

Note: This repository will be updated simultaneously with all weeks assignments

## Getting Started

To get started with the assignments, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/yash-dhingra/DS_Codes.git
```

2. Navigate to the assignment folder you want to work on. For example, for the first assignment:

```
cd Week_2_Lab_B/
```

3. Read the assignment instructions provided in the respective assignment folder. Each assignment folder contains a `README.md` file that explains the task, requirements, and submission details.

4. Write your code in the provided programming language (usually C++, Java, or Python). You can create a new folder within the assignment folder using your roll number or name to keep your solutions organized.

5. Test your code thoroughly on sample inputs to ensure it's working as expected.

6. Once you're satisfied with your solution, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Completed Assignment X"
git push origin main

```

7. Submit your assignment by creating a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository. Follow the naming convention for the pull request: "Assignment X: Your Name".

## Guidelines

- Follow the coding style guidelines provided in the assignment instructions.
- Comment your code appropriately to explain important logic and steps.
- Do not plagiarize or copy code from other sources. Your solutions should be your own work.
- Reach out to the instructors or teaching assistants if you have any questions or need clarification.

## Final Project

The final project is an opportunity to apply the data structure concepts learned throughout the semester to solve a real-world problem. Detailed instructions for the final project will be provided in the `final_project/` folder.

## Additional Resources

If you need further assistance with data structures and algorithms concepts, consider referring to these resources:

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [Coursera - Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
- [Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)

Happy coding and best of luck with your assignments! ðŸš€
